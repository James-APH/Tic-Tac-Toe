# Tic - Tac - Toe


## Purpose:
- The purpose of this project is to teach me how to use make files.

## Build Rules:
make all:
    makes all of the files nessecary for this project

make clean:
    removes the executables from the directory


## Game Play:

1. Program will output a question as to whether you would like to play a game, then it will ask if you would like to play single player or against AI (you will never win).

2. 

2. Upon starting the game, depending on who goes first the terminal will output asking which box you would like to declare as your own. 1 - 9.

3. Upon reaching a victory conditions the program will output the total wins, losses, and ties of each player.

4. The program will ask if you would like to play again.
